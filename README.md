Introduction Machine learning (ML)
Wikipedia, ML is the subfield of computer science that “gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”.Machine learning is a methodology enabling computers to make predictions or decisions from data by learning and discerning patterns within the data through iterative processes.
There are several types of machine learning approaches:
  *   Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data, the input information for the model comprises both features and labels. The objective is to map these features to labels through a numerical function.
  *   Unsupervised Learning: Involves discovering common characteristics within data, where the input information consists solely of features.
  *   Semi-supervised Learning: The fusion of Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning.
  *   Reinforcement Learning: Involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The environment also influences the agent's decisions. The goal of the agent is to optimize cumulative rewards over time. Rewards or penalties stem from the actions of the agent on the environment.

Currently, with remarkable advancements and enhanced computing power, along with vast amounts of data, Machine Learning has progressed to a further stage known as Deep Learning (DL). However, this doesn't diminish the significance of Machine Learning. The choice between Machine Learning and Deep Learning depends on the specific problem at hand.
